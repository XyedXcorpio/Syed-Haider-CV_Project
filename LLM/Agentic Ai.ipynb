            "text/markdown": "Your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm is correct and efficient. Here's a thorough critique with actionable recommendations and enhanced code examples:\n\n**Code Organization and Style**\n\n* The code is well-organized, and the function names are descriptive and follow the conventional naming conventions in Python (i.e., underscores instead of camel case).\n* The docstrings are informative and provide a brief explanation of each function's purpose, parameters, and return values. However, it's a good practice to include a blank line between the function definition and the docstring.\n* The code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with proper indentation, spacing, and line length.\n\n**Performance and Efficiency**\n\n* The time complexity of O(n log n) is optimal for the Merge Sort algorithm, and your implementation achieves this complexity.\n* The space complexity of O(n) is also optimal, as the algorithm requires a temporary array to store the merged result.\n\n**Code Readability and Maintainability**\n\n* The `merge` function is easy to understand, with clear variable names and a straightforward implementation.\n* In the `merge_sort` function, you could consider adding a comment to explain the recursive approach and the purpose of the `mid` variable.\n* Instead of using `i` and `j` as index variable names, consider using more descriptive names like `left_index` and `right_index` to improve code readability.\n\n**Minor Suggestions**\n\n* In the `merge` function, you could use a more descriptive variable name instead of `result` (e.g., `merged_array`).\n* In the `merge_sort` function, you could add a check to ensure that the input array is not empty before proceeding with the sorting process.\n\n**Enhanced Code Example**\n\nHere's the refactored code with the suggested improvements:\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of integers using the Merge Sort algorithm.\n\n    Time complexity: O(n log n)\n    Space complexity: O(n)\n\n    :param arr: The array to be sorted\n    :return: The sorted array\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:  # Check for empty input array\n        return arr\n\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr  # Base case: already sorted\n\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left = arr[:mid]\n    right = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort and merge the two halves\n    left = merge_sort(left)\n    right = merge_sort(right)\n\n    return merge(left, right)\n\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n\n    :param left: The first sorted array\n    :param right: The second sorted array\n    :return: The merged sorted array\n    \"\"\"\n    merged_array = []\n    left_index = right_index = 0\n\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:\n            merged_array.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged_array.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n\n    merged_array.extend(left[left_index:])\n    merged_array.extend(right[right_index:])\n\n    return merged_array\n\n\n# Example usage\narr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]\narr = merge_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", arr)\n```\nOverall, your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm is correct and efficient. The suggested improvements aim to enhance code readability, maintainability, and style."

            "* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Cucinare la Pasta**: Portare a ebollizione una grande pentola di acqua salata. Cuocere la pasta secondo le istruzioni del pacchetto fino a che non raggiunga la consistenza al dente. Riservare 1 tazza di acqua di cottura prima di scolare.\n",
            "2. **Soffriggere la Cipolla e l'Aglio**: In una grande padella, scaldare l'olio d'oliva a fuoco medio. Aggiungere la cipolla tritata e cuocere per 3-4 minuti, fino a che non diventi trasparente. Aggiungere l'aglio tritato e cuocere per un altro minuto, mescolando costantemente per evitare la combustione.\n",
            "3. **Aggiungere le Verdure Miste**: Aggiungere le verdure di primavera miste alla padella e cuocere per 4-5 minuti, fino a che non inizino ad ammorbidirsi. Aggiungere i pomodorini e cuocere per altri 2-3 minuti.\n",
            "4. **Aggiungere il Brodo e le Erbe**: Versare il brodo vegetale nella padella e aggiungere il basilico e l'origano secchi. Mescolare per combinare e portare la miscela a ebollizione.\n",
            "5. **Combinare la Pasta e la Miscela di Verdure**: Aggiungere la pasta cotta alla padella, mescolando tutto insieme per combinare. Se la miscela sembra asciutta, aggiungere un po' dell'acqua di cottura riservata.\n",
            "6. **Condire e Servire**: Condire il piatto di pasta con sale, pepe e lievito nutrizionale (se utilizzato). Servire caldo, guarnito con prezzemolo fresco tritato (se desiderato).\n",
